# This project was done in order to become more familiar with transfer learning.  
# I initially wanted to post this as a jupyter notebook but I decided to stick with my original plan.
# The images are in a zip folder because it was too large to have them uploaded.
# Anyways, you can clone this document and run it however you'd like, through the command line or any other platform.
